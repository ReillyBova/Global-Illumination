This directory contains skeleton code as a starting point for
the photon mapping assignment of COS 526. 

src/ - source code that can be used as a starting point for your implementation
input/ - Empty to start -- it will contain your input images
output/ - Empty to start -- it will contain your output images
Makefile - Script to run your program to produce the images in 
  the output directory from thefiles in the input directory


COMPILATION
===========

If you are developing on a Windows machine and have Visual Studio
installed, use the provided project file (src/photonmap.vcxproj)
to build the program. If you are developing on a Mac or Linux, cd into
the src/ directory and type "make".  In any case, executables called
photonmap (or photonmap.exe) will be created in the src/ directory.
